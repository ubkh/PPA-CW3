TODO LIST

- Behaviour for animals: Probability of not moving to a new square (Cheetahs have lower
probability)
- Decay method for dead animals: eg. possibly after 5-10 steps if not eaten by another animal
- Behaviours: We should aim for 2/3 behaviours - includes the behaviour where a predator doesnt have to eat is a behaviour.
- At specific time of day, the predator will always eat so there 100% chance of eating the food if its found.
- Sleep: method for each animal to adjust the sleeping times,
 or we could even do this in the animal class as an abstract method - we can have it so that female lions sleep for 1.5* the length of male lions
- All sleep during same time of day, may change later

- We can make elephants only move every 2 steps? - Maybe.
- Plant Grass, Plant PoisonBerries - the poison berries make you sleep.

- Predators can't see well in fog.

- Plants grow slower/ die in snow. They grow in all weather except snow.
- Size of grass can depend on RECENT rain + sun.
- Could instead make the size of the grass grow by a larger factor, if there's sun and rain in the past 4 weather types.
- Ideally what we actually want is more grass to be created
(override givebirth and the breeding probability (this is final which is an issue)???)


- Size influences food value of plant. Size of PoisonBerries influences poison level.

- At the end you could have a stats window (perhaps use the same code from assignment 1)

PRIORITIES
1. Implement behaviours, incl. weather and time-of-day
2. Stats window
3. Document
