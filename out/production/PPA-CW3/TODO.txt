TODO LIST

- Sort out Vulture class: Differentiate between killing and eating
- For predators that kill, determine what causes them to either eat/ not eat.
- Behaviour interfaces + implementation w/ different times of day
- No. of steps for each day - eg. 2400 steps per day
- Potentially, enum for different times of day
- Time of day + day displayed
- Behaviour for animals: Probability of not moving to a new square (Cheetahs have lower
probability)
- Decay method for dead animals: eg. possibly after 5-10 steps if not eaten by another animal
