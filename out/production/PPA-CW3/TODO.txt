TODO LIST

- Behaviour interfaces + implementation w/ different times of day
- No. of steps for each day - eg. 2400 steps per day
- Potentially, enum for different times of day
- Time of day + day displayed
- Behaviour for animals: Probability of not moving to a new square (Cheetahs have lower
probability)
- MAYBE: Decay method for dead animals: eg. possibly after 5-10 steps if not eaten by another animal


- Behaviours: We should aim for 2/3 behaviours - includes the behaviour where a predator doesnt have to eat is a behaviour.
- Midday field for each animal. when its this hour, the predator will always eat so there 100% chance of eating the food if its found.
- Sleep Interface with a method for each animal to adjust the sleeping times,
 or we could even do this in the animal class as an abstract method - we can have it so that female lions sleep for 1.5* the length of male lions

 - Lion sleep during hours 17 to 24

- We can make elephants only move every 2 steps? - Maybe.
- we can have a fighting mechnaisim between cheetah and Lion - so during certain times of day they may be able to kill eachother.
- Plant Grass, Plant PoisonBerries - the poison berries make you sleep.

- At the end you could have a stats window (perhaps use the same code from assignment 1)
